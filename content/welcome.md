## Goals for this workshop

- **Inspire teachers and staff who teach technical topics:** Use best practices, especially for online teaching.
- **Promote collaboration in teaching**.
- **Motivate new instructors** to take up our lessons, remix them, and to contribute.
- **Get feedback** to improve the material as well as our collaboration model.
- **Catalyze and form new networks** and collaborations of teachers and trainers of
  practical scientific computing.


### Giving confidence

> *Goal number one should be that we give participants the confidence to
> independently apply the tools or knowledge learnt. This is more important
> that giving a "complete" overview.* [Lucy Whalley gave this great comment at a CodeRefinery workshop]
