```{discussion}
- Are there any lessons in the list above that you would like to use in your own teaching?
- (After the instructor gives an overview of one of the lessons) What do you think about this 
  lesson format? How does it compare to training material that you use?
```

## Recommended external resources

The lessons above do not cover all relevant topics in HPC, HPDA and AI, but 
ENCCS also maintains a list of recommended public training material which you 
can find at [https://enccs.se/external-training-resources/](https://enccs.se/external-training-resources/).

```{challenge} Contribute to the list of external training resources 
**For after this workshop:**  
If you know of other good public training material, or if you have developed own material 
that you would like to share with the world, please [get in touch](https://enccs.se/contact/) or 
[open an issue](https://github.com/ENCCS/instructor-training/issues) on this repository!
